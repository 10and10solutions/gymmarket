# gymmarket
## a simple app for working out, without the cost

### We know you already have to pay for a gym membership which is already expensive. But, a lot of us don't know what workouts to do or how to do them...
that's why we created gymmarket. It's a simple app that allows users, certified personal trainers or users that have held titles in workout competitions, own gyms and
workout studios to create workout routines made for everyday people and the die-hard lifter. We don't want you to have any commitment to any one workout app or routine, we want you to have them all and use them all.
We can't wait to see what you create and use to workout!
